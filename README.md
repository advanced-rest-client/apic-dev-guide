# Readme

This is a developer guide for API Components. It is moved from old `advanced-rest-client/arc-dev-guide` repository.

API Components is a set \(an ecosystem\) of web components build for API tooling. Initially the component were to be used in Advanced REST Client and API Console. They, however, can be used in any project that requires UI or logic for API tools.

The ecosystem contains components to build UI for HTTP request editors, HTTP code snippets, response views, data views, API documentation, etc. Components that start with `arc-` prefix are targeted to be used exclusively in ARC project. However, the whole project is OSS so the components can be used in different project as long as they fit the purpose.
