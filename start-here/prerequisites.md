# Prerequisites

We try to make it as easy for you to start coding API Components. However, some steps has to be taken before jumping into the code. It will make it easy for you and us to understand each other while filing a pull request.

* We recommend using Unix based OS \(Ubuntu, MacOS\) as the tooling for these platforms is just better.
* You need to have [node](https://nodejs.org) installed on your development machine.
* Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) as well.
* You may use any web components library you want. But make sure the library does not pollute global namespace and can be used with the most popular build systems.
* The components are build using [LitElement](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) and follow [open-wc](https://open-wc.org/) standards. Get familiar with both as this will save overall time for all.
* Make sure you understand [Web Components APIs and architecture](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-components/customelements). This documentation will not cover basics of Web Components. We assume you already know that.
* Per `advanced-rest-client` organization policy you will have to sign your commits before publishing a pull request. Follow [this instructions](https://help.github.com/en/articles/signing-commits) to enable commits signing. There will be no exceptions from this rule as we want to be sure that PRs are published by a person who intended to do this.
