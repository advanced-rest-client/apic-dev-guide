# Component initialization

As described in the Start here section, API Components uses LitElement and open-wc standard. It, however uses some customizations to the linting. 

The quickest way to bootstrap a new component is to use npm init command for open-wc:

```text
npm init @open-wc
```

When asked select a web component template, and then select template options to include linting, demoing, and testing.
